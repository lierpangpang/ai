# AI SDK - OpenAI Compatible Provider

This package aims to provide a base to speed and support the implementation of a
range of concrete OpenAI-compatible providers. Given this purpose, it is not
itself a concrete provider intended for direct instantiation and use.

The primary [OpenAI provider](../openai/README.md) is heavier-weight than what
this package offers. That provider also includes OpenAI-specific experimental
and legacy features which may not be relevant for more general purpose
OpenAI-compatible providers.
