# Migrate AI SDK 3.4 to 4.0

<Note type="warning">
  AI SDK 4.0 has not been released yet. It is currently a canary version and
  there will be more breaking changes. We will update this guide as we make
  progress.
</Note>

## Recommended Process

1. [Migrate to AI SDK 3.4](/docs/troubleshooting/migration-guide/migration-guide-3-4).
2. Resolve all deprecation warnings.
3. Upgrade to AI SDK 4.0.
4. _Optional_: Run the [codemod](#codemods) automated migrations.
5. Follow the breaking changes guide below.

## Codemods

The AI SDK provides Codemod transformations to help upgrade your codebase when a
feature is deprecated, removed, or otherwise changed.

Codemods are transformations that run on your codebase programmatically. They
allow you to easily apply many changes without having to manually go through
every file.

Codemods are intended as a tool to help you with the upgrade process. They may
not cover all of the changes you need to make. You may need to make additional
changes manually.

You can run all codemods provided as part of the 4.0 upgrade process by running
the following command from the root of your project:

```sh
npx @ai-sdk/codemod upgrade
```

Individual codemods can be run by specifying the name of the codemod:

```sh
npx @ai-sdk/codemod <codemod-name> <path>
```

The latest set of codemods can be found in the
[`@ai-sdk/codemod`](https://github.com/vercel/ai/tree/main/packages/codemod/src/codemods) repository.
