- [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/observability/how_to_guides/tracing/trace_with_vercel_ai_sdk)
- [Braintrust](/providers/observability/braintrust)
- [Laminar](https://docs.lmnr.ai/tracing/vercel-ai-sdk)

There are also providers that provide monitoring and tracing for the AI SDK through model wrappers:
